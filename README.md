# CS-470-Full-Stack-Development-2

Experiences and Strengths:
Professional Goals: This course provides practical experience in AWS cloud-native solutions, essential for my goal of becoming a soultion architect in the cloud.

Skills Developed: I gained hands-on experience with AWS services and microservices, enhancing my marketability in modern development practices.

Strengths as a Developer: My strengths include problem-solving, adaptability, and collaboration skills, enabling effective teamwork.

Prepared Roles: I am ready for roles like Cloud Developer, Full-Stack Developer, or Solutions Architect, leveraging my cloud knowledge.


Planning for Growth:
Knowledge Synthesis: I learned that microservices and serverless architectures boost application scalability and efficiency.

Scale and Error Management: I would use auto-scaling and monitoring tools to manage traffic and implement centralized logging for error handling.

Cost Prediction: I would analyze usage patterns and use AWS Cost Explorer for cost forecasting.

Cost Predictability: Serverless architectures are generally more cost-predictable than containers, charging based on actual usage.


Pros and Cons for Expansion:

Pros: Scalability, reduced management overhead, and flexible resource allocation.

Cons: Vendor lock-in, complexity in microservices management, and debugging challenges.

Elasticity and Pay-for-Service: Elasticity enables dynamic scaling based on demand, while pay-for-service aligns costs with usage, both vital for growth decision-making.
